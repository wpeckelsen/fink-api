okay. I will just send you snippets of the docs, and hopefully you can piece together how to make a working request.


The OpenFoodFacts API has two deployments.

Production: https://world.openfoodfacts.org
Staging: https://world.openfoodfacts.net

Consider using the staging environment if you are not in a production scenario.

Staging require an http basic auth to avoid search engine indexing. The username is off, and the password off. Here is a small javascript code that you can test in your browser console:

fetch("https://world.openfoodfacts.net/api/v2/product/3274080005003.json", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: { Authorization: "Basic " + btoa("off:off") },
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((json) => console.log(json)

We ask you to always use a custom User-Agent to identify your app (to not risk being identified as a bot). The User-Agent should be in the form of AppName/Version (ContactEmail). For example, MyApp/1.0 (myapp@example.com).

READ operations (getting info about a product, etc...) do not require authentication other than the custom User-Agent.
WRITE operations (Editing an Existing Product, Uploading images…) require authentication. We do this as another layer of protection against spam.






Get Product Details
get /api/v2/product/{barcode}
Fetches product details by its unique barcode. Can return all product details or specific fields like knowledge panels.

Use the blame parameter to include information about who last modified each field of the product.


REQUEST
PATH PARAMETERS
* barcode
string
3017620422003
The barcode of the product to be fetched

Examples: 3017620422003
QUERY-STRING PARAMETERS
product_type
enum
petfood
Allowed: all ┃ beauty ┃ food ┃ petfood ┃ product
Used for READ queries for one product. Expected product type of the requested product. Defaults to the product type of the server the query is sent to (e.g. 'food' for Open Food Facts, 'beauty' for Open Beauty Facts, etc.). 'all' matches all product types. If the product exists on a different server that matches the requested product type, the API will return a 302 redirect to the correct server. Otherwise, the API will return a 404 error. It is possible that new product types will be added in the future.

Examples: all ┃ food
fields
string
knowledge_panels
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+(,[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+)*$
Specific fields to return. Use 'knowledge_panels' for Knowledge Panels only.

knowledge_panels_included
string
heatlh_card, environment_card
When knowledge_panels are requested, you can specify which panels should be in the response. All the others will be excluded.

Examples: heatlh_card, environment_card
knowledge_panels_excluded
string
heatlh_card, environment_card
When knowledge_panels are requested, you can specify which panels to exclude from the response. All the others will be included. If a panel is both excluded and included (with the knowledge_panels_excluded parameter), it will be excluded.

Examples: heatlh_card, environment_card
blame
string
1
Include blame information in the response showing who last modified each field of the product. The blame information contains the user ID, timestamp, revision number, and value for each field. Set to a non-empty and non-0 value (e.g. 1 or true) to enable.
